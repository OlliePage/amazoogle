## Performance Features

- Starts loading before Amazon's original interface becomes visible
- Optimized CSS transitions for smooth appearance
- Smart detection of user's preferred color scheme

## How It Works

Amazoogle uses content scripts that load at document start to detect when you're on Amazon UK's homepage. It efficiently replaces the interface with a minimalist version before the original content is displayed, eliminating any flash of unwanted content.

The extension preserves Amazon's core functionality while removing the distracting elements and uses Chrome's storage API for persistent settings.
